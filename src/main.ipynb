Il concetto di prosumer si riferisce a individui o entit√† che non sono soltanto consumatori di prodotti e servizi, ma anche produttori degli stessi. Questo fenomeno √® cresciuto considerevolmente con l'avvento di Internet e delle tecnologie digitali, che hanno reso pi√π facile per le persone non solo consumare contenuti, ma anche crearli e condividerli.\n","\n","Nel contesto dell'energia, il termine \"prosumer\" assume una particolare rilevanza con riferimento a quelle persone o aziende che producono energia‚Äîtipicamente da fonti rinnovabili come il solare o l'eolico‚Äîper il proprio uso e vendono l'eccesso alla rete elettrica. Questo √® diventato pi√π accessibile grazie alla diminuzione dei costi delle tecnologie rinnovabili e alla maggiore disponibilit√† di opzioni per il finanziamento. I prosumer in questo settore sono quindi attori chiave nella transizione verso sistemi energetici pi√π distribuiti e sostenibili, contribuendo alla riduzione delle emissioni di gas serra e alla promozione di un'economia circolare.\n","\n","In un contesto sociale e economico pi√π ampio, il concetto di prosumer rappresenta un cambio di paradigma rispetto al modello tradizionale di produzione e consumo. Invece di essere passivi consumatori, i prosumer sono attivamente coinvolti nel processo di creazione di valore, che pu√≤ portare a nuovi modelli di business, a una maggiore personalizzazione dei prodotti e servizi e a una maggiore enfasi sulla sostenibilit√†."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Import LIBs and
