{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Prosumer Energy Prediction"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Il termine \"prosumer\" Ã¨ un portmanteau che combina le parole \"producer\" (produttore) e \"consumer\" (consumatore). Il concetto di prosumer si riferisce a individui o entitÃ  che non sono soltanto consumatori di prodotti e servizi, ma anche produttori degli stessi. Questo fenomeno Ã¨ cresciuto considerevolmente con l'avvento di Internet e delle tecnologie digitali, che hanno reso piÃ¹ facile per le persone non solo consumare contenuti, ma anche crearli e condividerli.\n","\n","Nel contesto dell'energia, il termine \"prosumer\" assume una particolare rilevanza con riferimento a quelle persone o aziende che producono energiaâ€”tipicamente da fonti rinnovabili come il solare o l'eolicoâ€”per il proprio uso e vendono l'eccesso alla rete elettrica. Questo Ã¨ diventato piÃ¹ accessibile grazie alla diminuzione dei costi delle tecnologie rinnovabili e alla maggiore disponibilitÃ  di opzioni per il finanziamento. I prosumer in questo settore sono quindi attori chiave nella transizione verso sistemi energetici piÃ¹ distribuiti e sostenibili, contribuendo alla riduzione delle emissioni di gas serra e alla promozione di un'economia circolare.\n","\n","In un contesto sociale e economico piÃ¹ ampio, il concetto di prosumer rappresenta un cambio di paradigma rispetto al modello tradizionale di produzione e consumo. Invece di essere passivi consumatori, i prosumer sono attivamente coinvolti nel processo di creazione di valore, che puÃ² portare a nuovi modelli di business, a una maggiore personalizzazione dei prodotti e servizi e a una maggiore enfasi sulla sostenibilitÃ .\n","\n","\n","*We PROduce and conSUME our output, we are prosuming. Prosuming purpose is to Share.*\n","\n","Currently, in most countries, energy systems are transitioning from a centralized to a distributed model, and in the long-term, they are foreseen as smart and connected models using advanced emerging information technologies, called the energy Internet (EI). This change of model was already envisioned, proving that any electric power system, irrespective of size, can be modelled as a prosumer, defined as an economically motivated entity that consumes, produces, and stores power; operates a power grid; and optimizes the economic decisions regarding its energy utilization."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Import LIBs and
